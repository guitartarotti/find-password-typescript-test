# ZBRA Challenge

- The challenge lasts for up to 3 days - counting from the time the repository invitation was sent (it's okay if you need a little more time);
- The whole challenge is in english, so read it carefully;
- Test instructions are inside the `instructions` directory;
- Only code present in the `main` branch will be considered;
- You can use whatever programming language you want!

And finally, we hope you do your best ðŸ¥‡

# Thanks for the opportunity 

  - Language Used => `JavaScript` with your superset `TypeScript`
  - Runtime Environment => `Node.js` with a `Express.js` framework
  - Documentation => `Swagger.js` for rest api
  - Javascript linting => `ESLint`
  - Tests Framework => `Jest`
  - Software Engineering Principles => `DDD`, `SOLID`, `TDD`

  Application configured to be accessed through: http://localhost:3333

     - The simulation routes are responsible for question 1

       through the post method, the minimum value of the password will be sent, the maximum value, and finally which rules will be active  

       ```JSON
          {minValue: 184759, maxValue: 856920, rules: [1,1,1]}
       ```

       There are 3 rule options, the first (one double), the second (left to right, the digits only increase or remain the same). Which are all from Part 1
       
       And the last one from Part 2 (must have at least one group of exactly two of the same characters)

       ```JSON
          {rules: [1/*to active*/, 0/*to disable*/, 1]}
       ```

       I elaborated the system, because I identified a necessary control of the application, for the scalability of the solution based on possible future problems, such as the one that appeared in Part 2

    - The command route are responsible for question 2

      only 1 get method, it will bring the address number


    - Don't worry, all routes are documented in swagger and can be accessed via: http://localhost:3333/api-docs/

    - All settings are also saved and documented, from TypeScript with ESLint to Jest


    PS: I am available to explain everything that has been coded (In fact, I think the best way to present) ;)
