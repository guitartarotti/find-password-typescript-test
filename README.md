# ZBRA Challenge

- The challenge lasts for up to 3 days - counting from the time the repository invitation was sent (it's okay if you need a little more time);
- The whole challenge is in english, so read it carefully;
- Test instructions are inside the `instructions` directory;
- Only code present in the `main` branch will be considered;
- You can use whatever programming language you want!

And finally, we hope you do your best ðŸ¥‡
